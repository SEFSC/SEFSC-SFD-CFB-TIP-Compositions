In preparation for SouthEast Data, Assessment, and Review (SEDAR) 84, size composition analysis of the Trip Interview Program (TIP) data available for the St. Croix region was conducted. The results in this document provide span data collected from 1988 to 2022. This work was conducted by the Southeast Fisheries Science Center, Sustainable Fisheries Division, Caribbean Fisheries Branch.

There are two main portions of this document. First, gear groupings were established based on a general linear model (GLM) analysis. The GLM analysis used a gamma-distributed dependent variable. Second, the size composition of each gear grouping was determined.

## Generalized Linear Model (GLM) Analysis

The GLM analysis was first conducted on the time series as a whole (1988-2022), and then on a truncated time series to best reflect the available commercial landings data (2012-2022). The analysis of the full and truncated time series display the statistical similarity of all available gears to one another in respect to the size of fish caught throughout the time series. To analyze the gears, the gear name variable was used for all analysis.

The GLM analysis of the full time series reported a statistical difference between the SPEAR and POTS AND TRAPS;FISH gears. However, the truncated time series investigation showed no statistical significance between available gears. Thus all available gears were grouped into "DIVING" or "OTHER" according to their relative similarity in use to those of SPEAR and POTS AND TRAPS;FISH.

The column titled "group" indicates the group(s) that the gear can statistically be included in, and thus be statistically similar to the other gears grouped similarly. The "n" column indicates the number of unique lengths recorded for each gear. The "Percentage" column inticates the percent of the total recorded fish lengths that are included within each gear.

The "n" column indicates the number of unique lengths recorded for each gear. The "ID" column indicates the number of distinct trip ID's associated with each gear. The "Percentage" column inticates the percent(n_fish) of the total recorded fish lengths that are included within each gear.

## Aggregated Gear Density

The aggregated gear density was plotted for all time periods and gear groupings for which GLM analysis was conducted. Each plot includes mean lines for each gear or gear grouping where applicable. N equals the number of individual lengths recorded for each gear or gear grouping respectively.
